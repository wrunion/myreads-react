# React Udacity: MyReads

## About
This is a book search app for Udacity's React Nanodegree. This application allows users to search for books from a 3rd party API, and add books to their "bookshelves." It's an exercise in component state. 

## To Run
* download the code to your local machine: 
```git clone https://github.com/wrunion/udacity-react-project-1.git```
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Quirks
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). You can also search by title or author, but keyword searching will fail unless it is one of the cached search terms.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
